Reflection on Using Git and GitHub for Our Portfolio Project
In our project, we created a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There were two of us working together,
 and we divided our tasks to make the work easier. Each of us created separate branches for our work. We cloned the repository
 to our local machines and used various Git commands to commit our changes, including git commit, git push, and git pull.

During the project, we faced a problem when I tried to commit changes to the style.css file. Even though I saved the
 file, I couldn't commit the changes. After troubleshooting, I discovered that the issue was caused by the file being
 stuck in the remote repository. To resolve this, I deleted the style.css file from the remote repository and pushed my changes again.
 After this, everything ran smoothly, and we were able to work without further issues.

In the end, we pushed all our work to the main branch and pulled it into our local repositories.
 Overall, my experience using Git and GitHub for this project was very positive. I learned that GitHub makes collaboration
 easy and efficient, even when working with a partner. I didn't know it would be so straightforward to manage our project with Git. 
The ability to track changes, resolve conflicts, and work on separate branches helped us stay organized and focused.
 This experience has shown me the many advantages of using Git and GitHub, and I will definitely use these tools in future projects..
